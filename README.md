There's not much in the repo. Just read this readme file :D

Though the project name is TryXcodeBot, I gave up using Xcode Bot (because at the moment I couldn't make the TestFlight upload part to work! because of code signing and provisioning profile issues). So I switched to [Jenkins](https://jenkins-ci.org/).

For Apple TestFlight upload, there are a few alternatives, e.g. [nomad/shenzhen](https://github.com/nomad/shenzhen), [KrauseFx/deliver](https://github.com/KrauseFx/deliver), and [fastlane/pilot](https://github.com/fastlane/pilot). They are very similar, just choose what you like.

See my medium post for requirements and on how to setup.
